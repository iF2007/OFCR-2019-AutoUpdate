// [BODY]  - a rigid mass with mass and inertial properties
// [JOINT] - a ball joint constraining an offset of one body to an
//           offset of another body (eliminates 3 DOF)
// [HINGE] - a constraint restricting the relative rotations of two
//           bodies to be around a single axis (eliminates 2 DOF).
// [BAR]   - a constraint holding an offset of one body from an offset of
//           another body at a fixed distance (eliminates 1 DOF).
// [JOINT&HINGE] - both the joint and hinge constraints, forming the
//           conventional definition of a hinge (eliminates 5 DOF).
